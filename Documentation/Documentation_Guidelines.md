# Documentation Guidelines

## Before Contributing
The documentation for this project will serve as a learning resource for anyone using this repository to learn problem solving with data structures and algorithms. Please ensure that you clearly explain your approach to a particular problem and why you thought that would be a good way to solve it, while mentioning the time and space complexity. Include pseudo code wherever necessary.

### Guidelines
- Create a folder with your name in the Documentation folder, following the format Firstname_Lastname.
- Within that folder, create a markdown file for the documentation of each problem.
    - The filename for each problem will follow the format category_problem.md, all letters being lowercase.
    - For example, for the documentation of the problem push_zero from the Array category, array_push_zero.md will be the filename.
- **Be consistent in the usage of these guidelines.**
